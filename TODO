This is just the current plan, plans change.

0.8.1 [8'08] (aka "growth"):
- Publishing:
  * clean up indexing with gnunet-insert (#1107)
  * power insert (#854)
  * insert meta-data under hash (md5? sha1? sha-512? GNUnet-URI?)
    as keyword (to allow getting meta-data from URI only)
- Correctness: 
  * clean up and test VPN code
  * test RPC code (write a small demo)
- Ease of use:
  * improve gnunet-setup (more auto-detection in wizards, more testing)
  * external IP detector webpage

0.8.2 [12'08] (aka "integration"):
- Performance:
  * tune DHT
  * tune GAP query planning code
- Build-in primitives:
  * OR service
  * testbed using remote testing topology setup
  * SMTP logger 
- Transports:
  * direct WiFi transport
  * HTTPS support (#1225)
  * support NAT-PMP (in addition to UPnP)

0.8.3 [5'09] (aka "chat"):
- P2P chat


1.0.0 [6'09] (aka "userfriendly"):
- transport selection (given multiple choices,
  how should GNUnet pick a transport?)




FreeServices (random notes)
- onion routing
  * application service
  * unreliable connection through GNUnet core
  * initiator chooses path, other ORs suggest some (!) ORs for next hop
    (choose path often according to suggestions, but route randomly
     sometimes)
  * accounting 
    + each predecessor ist reposible (accountable) for its predecessor
      and has to reject connections from untrusted nodes because
      misbehaving nodes harm own trust
    + tell predecessor about MIN(own limits, successor's limits)
  * onion routing based transport
    + use introduction point instead of IP in HELLO
      => integrate NATed hosts
- subnet advertising (DHT, chat, GAP, ...)
  + applications register subnets, core advertises subnets
- anonymous DHT
  + create OR tunnel to ADHT node that performs DHT operation
  + check success of DHT operation through another tunnel
  + => OR and FreeService advertisements
