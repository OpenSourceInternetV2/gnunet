 *
 * COMPLETED_JOINED means that the download is finished and
 * the thread has been joined.<br>
 *
 * ABORTED means that the user is causing the download to be
 * terminated early (but the thread has not been joined yet).  The
 * controller or the download thread make this transition; the
 * download thread is supposed to terminate shortly after the state is
 * moved to ABORTED.<br>
 *
 * ABORTED_JOINED means that the download did not complete
 * successfully, should not be restarted and that the thread
 * has been joined.<br>
 *
 * ERROR means that some fatal error is causing the download to be
 * terminated early (but the thread has not been joined yet).  The
 * controller or the download thread make this transition; the
 * download thread is supposed to terminate shortly after the state is
 * moved to ERROR.<br>
 *
 * ERROR_JOINED means that the download did not complete successfully,
 * should not be restarted and that the thread has been joined.<br>
 *
 * SUSPENDING is used to notify the download thread that it
 * should terminate because of an FSUI shutdown.  After this
 * termination the code that joins the thread should move
 * the state into PENDING (a new thread would not be started
 * immediately because "threadPoolSize" will be 0 until FSUI
