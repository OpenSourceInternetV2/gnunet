/**
 * @file applications/afs/module/large_file_support.h
 * @brief Support for special handling of very large (3HASH) reply sets.
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * The databases (gdbm in particular, but also the others) do not
 * handle very large entries very well.  This is no problem for CHK,
 * but there can be several thousand (!)  results for a very popular
 * keyword, like a mime-type.  These 3HASH codes with more than
 * VERY_LARGE_SIZE (16) results are thus stored in separate files.
 *
 * The reason is, that gdbm would grow quadratic when the file is
 * build and that it would also be very slow: every read or write to
 * these very large content entries would require reading and writing
 * the *entire* 2 MB block (2 MB for 2,000 entries).  This API allows
 * a random access to one of the results and the use of "append" to
 * add a single entry.  It also does not suffer from the quadratic
 * explosion in space consumption that gdbm has.  So essentially, this
 * is a crapload of code that does not add any real functionality but
 * overcomes problems with the crude database implementations that we
 * would have to use otherwise (and that would be really bad for
 * performance without this).
