/**
 * @file applications/vpn/vpn.h
 * @author Michael John Wensley
 * @brief tunnel RFC 4193 in GNUnet
 *
 *
 * http://gnunet.wensley.org.uk/
 *
 * Yes this will thoroughly break most of the coding guidelines :-/ at least the first release.
 *
 * We use IPv6 addresses because they provide a larger space, and are
 * not as likely to be in use by other applications such as NAT.
 *
 * We also follow the guidance in RFC4193 and use only the 40 bits
 * specified for the randomly generated publickey. This allows nodes
 * to connect subnets to the network.
 *
 * It also allows interoperation with other users of this space such
 * as anonymous internets. We use GNUnet to benefit from its key
 * infrastructure, though other users may well rip fdxx:: bits
 * directly from public keys, using the private key to GNUNET_RSA_sign
 * route announcements.
 *
 * CHANGELOG:
 * 20060110 Change ifconfig/route to ioctl's
 * 20060111 P2P packet includes length of the header.
 * 20060802 Logging for multiple clients
