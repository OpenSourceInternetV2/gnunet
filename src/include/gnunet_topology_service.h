 * @brief topology service API
 *
 * Note that while there are few requests that will be made
 * specifically to the topology, the topology service should do a lot
 * more: topology should be actively establishing connections, even if
 * they are not requested explicitly.
 *
 * Topology is responsible for deciding which sessions should be
 * established, which ones should be maintained and which ones
 * should be shut down.  Topology is also responsible for sending
 * PINGs in time to keep alive sessions that are otherwise in
 * danger of timing out.
 *
 * Actual time-outs are done by the core.  Topology may also
 * request the core to shutdown a connection explictly (before
 * the timeout).
 *
 * Topology relies on advertising to learn about other peers, and
 * on session for establishing sessions.
