/**
 * @file include/gnunet_fsui_lib.h
 * @brief support for GNUnet file-sharing user interfaces
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 * @see include/gnunet_ecrs_lib.h
 *
 * Writing a UI for GNUnet is now easier then ever before.  Basically,
 * the UI first calls GNUNET_FSUI_start, passing a callback that the UI uses
 * to process events (like completed downloads, search results, etc.).
 * The event processor does not have to be re-entrant, FSUI will only
 * call it once at a time (but possibly from different threads, the
 * event processor also may have to worry about synchronizing itself
 * with the GUI library to display updates).<p>
 *
 * After creating a GNUNET_FSUI_Context with GNUNET_FSUI_start the UI can start,
 * abort and stop uploads, downloads, deletions or searches.
 * The GNUNET_FSUI_Context can be destroyed, when it is created again
 * the next time all pending operations are resumed (!).
 * Clients can use the various iterator functions to obtain
 * information about pending actions.<p>
 *
 * Note that there can only be one GNUNET_FSUI_Context for a given
 * client application name if resuming is enabled.
 * Creating an GNUNET_FSUI_Context may _fail_ if any other UI is currently
 * running (for the same user and application name).<p>
 *
 * Clients may use SOME functions of GNUnet's ECRS library, in
 * particular functions to deal with URIs and MetaData, but generally
 * FSUI functions should be preferred over ECRS functions (since FSUI
 * keeps state, performs additional tracking operations and avoids
 * blocking the client while operations are pending).<p>
 *
 * Closing an GNUNET_FSUI_Context may take a while as the context may need
 * to serialize some state and complete operations that may not be
 * interrupted (such as communications with gnunetd).  Clients
 * may want to open a window informing the user about the pending
 * shutdown operation.<p>
 *
 * Any "start" operation will result in FSUI state and memory
 * being allocated until it is paired with a "stop" operation.
 * Before calling "stop", one of three things must happen:
 * Either, the client receives an "error" (something went wrong)
 * or "completed" (action finished) event.  Alternatively, the
 * client may call "abort" which will result in an "aborted"
 * event.  In either case, the event itself will NOT result in
 * the memory being released by FSUI -- the client must still
 * call "stop" explicitly.  Clients that call "stop" before an
 * aborted, error or completed event will be blocked until
 * an error or completion event happens (it is illegal for a
 * client to call "abort" after calling "stop").<p>
 *
 * Using the Event mechanism, clients can associate an arbitrary
 * pointer with any operation (upload, download, search or
 * deletion).  The pointer is initialized using the return value
 * from the respective start or resume events.  If any memory
 * is associated with the datastructure, the client should free
 * that memory when suspend or stop events are issued.  For all
 * events (other than start/resume), FSUI will track and provide
 * the client pointer as part of the event (cctx field).<p>

 * download thread is supposed to terminate shortly after the state is
 * moved to ABORTED.<br>

 * ERROR means that some fatal error is causing the download to be

 *
 * SUSPENDING is used to notify the download thread that it

 * change 'name' to something else (such that the user can resume
 * state from another GUI).  Shell UIs on the other hand should set
 * doResume to GNUNET_NO and may hard-wire a 'name' (which has no semantic
 * meaning, however, the name of the UI would still be a good choice).
