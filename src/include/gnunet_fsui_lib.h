/**
 * @file include/gnunet_fsui_lib.h
 * @brief support for FS user interfaces
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * Writing a UI for GNUnet is now easier then ever before.  Basically,
 * the UI first calls FSUI_start, passing a callback that the UI uses
 * to process events (like completed downloads, search results, etc.).
 * The event processor does not have to be re-entrant, FSUI will only
 * call it once at a time (but possibly from different threads, the
 * event processor also may have to worry about synchronizing itself
 * with the GUI library to display updates).<p>
 *
 * After creating a FSUI_Context with FSUI_start the UI can start (or
 * cancel) uploads, downloads or searches.  The FSUI_Context can be
 * destroyed, when it is created again the next time all pending
 * operations are resumed (!).  Clients can use the various iterator
 * functions to obtain information about pending actions.<p>
 *
 * Note that there can only be one FSUI_Context for all clients.
 * Creating an FSUI_Context may _fail_ if any other UI is currently
 * running (for the same user).<p>
 *
 * Clients may use SOME functions of GNUnet's ECRS library, in
 * particular functions to deal with URIs and MetaData, but generally
 * FSUI functions should be preferred over ECRS functions (since FSUI
 * keeps state, performs additional tracking operations and avoids
 * blocking the client while operations are pending).<p>
 *
 * Closing an FSUI_Context may take a while as the context may need
 * to serialize some state and complete operations that may not be
 * interrupted (such as indexing / unindexing operations). If this
 * is not acceptable, clients should wait until all uploads and
 * unindexing operations have completed before attempting to close
 * the FSUI_Context.<p>
 *
 * Note that most of this code is completely new in GNUnet 0.7.0 and
 * thus still highly experimental.  Suggestions are welcome.
