/**
 * @file include/gnunet_sqstore_service.h
 * @brief An SQ store is responsible for storing blocks with
 *   additional indices that allow traversing the store in
 *   order of expiration time or priority, in addition to
 *   queries by key and block type.  The name comes from SQL,
 *   because using an SQL database to do this should be
 *   particularly easy.  But that is of course not the only
 *   way to implement an sqstore.
