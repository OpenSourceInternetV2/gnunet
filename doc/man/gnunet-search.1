.TH GNUNET-SEARCH "1" "20 Mar 2004" "GNUnet"
.SH NAME
gnunet-search \- a command line interface to search for content on GNUnet 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-search
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] KEYWORD [AND KEYWORD]*
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Search for content on GNUnet. The keywords are case-sensitive.
.TP
\fB\-a \fILEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-anonymity=LEVEL\fR
set additional receiver anonymity enforcing. If unset, 
value specified in config file is used. Default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print help page
.TP
\fB\-c \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config=FILENAME\fR
use config file (defaults: ~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version number
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fITIMEOUT\fR
wait TIMEOUT seconds before aborting the search.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fIMAXRESULTS\fR
exit after finding MAXRESULTS results.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fINAMESPACE\fR
Searches the given NAMESPACE.  The keyword argument specified is used as the identifier in the namespace.
.TP
\fB\-o PREFIX, \fB\-\-output=PREFIX\fR
This option only works together with -s (at the moment).
Writes encountered (unencrypted) SBlocks to files with name
PREFIX.XXX, where XXX is a number. This may be useful e.g.
if you forgot to save the SBlock when inserting a periodical.
.TP
\fB\-L \fILOGLEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL\fR
change the loglevel. Possible values for LOGLEVEL are NOTHING, FATAL, ERROR, FAILURE, WARNING, MESSAGE, INFO, DEBUG, CRON and EVERYTHING.
.SH NOTES
The -t option specifies that the query should timeout after approximately TIMEOUT seconds. A value of zero is interpreted as never. The default value can be changed via the SEARCHTIMEOUT variable in the GNUnet configuration file. If multiple words are passed as keywords that are not separated by an AND, gnunet-search will concatenate them to one bigger keyword. Thus

# gnunet-search Das Kapital

and

# gnunet-search "Das Kapital"

are identical. You can use AND to separate keywords. In that case, gnunet-search will only display results that match all the keywords. gnunet-search can not do multiple independent queries ("OR"), you must use multiple processes for that. Mind that each GNUnet-server (gnunetd) has a build-in limit on the number of clients (like gnunet-search or gnunet-download) that can connect simultaniously (you can change it in src/include/config.h).

Search results are printed by gnunet-search like this:

gnunet-download -o "COPYING" gnunet://afs/77DBE6F971D66F641B2262DDCE78CA8FB6815E60.E34BFD7843D4C8469EFC3DAD260F1F71783E2A87.466DC92.17992
=> The GNU Public License <= (mimetype: unknown)

The first value line is the command to run to download the file. The suggested filename in the example is COPYING. The GNUnet URI consists of the key and query hash of the file, the CRC32 (GNUnet style) and finally the size of the file. The second line contains the description of the file, here "The GNU Public License" and the mime-type (see the options for gnunet-insert on how to change these).

.SH SETTING ANONYMITY LEVEL

The \fB-a\fR option can be used to specify additional anonymity
constraints. If set to 0, GNUnet will try to download the
file as fast as possible without any additional
slowdown by the anonymity code. Note that you
will still have a fair degree of anonymity depending
on the current network load and the power of the
adversary. The download is still unlikely to be
terribly fast since the sender may have requested
sender-anonymity and since in addition to that,
GNUnet will still do the anonymous routing.

This option can be used to limit requests further
than that. In particular, you can require GNUnet to
receive certain amounts of traffic from other peers
before sending your queries. This way, you can gain
very high levels of anonymity - at the expense of
much more traffic and much higher latency. So set
it only if you really believe you need it. 

The definition of ANONYMITY-RECEIVE is the following:
  If the value v is < 1000, it means that if GNUnet
  routes n bytes of messages from foreign peers, it
  may originate n/v bytes of queries in the same time-period.
  The time-period is twice the average delay that GNUnet
  deferrs forwarded queries.

  If the value v is >= 1000, it means that if GNUnet
  routes n bytes of QUERIES from at least (v % 1000)
  peers, it may originate n/v/1000 bytes of queries
  in the same time-period.

The default is 0 and this should be fine for most
users. Also notice that if you choose values above
1000, you may end up having no throughput at all,
especially if many of your fellow GNUnet-peers do
the same.
