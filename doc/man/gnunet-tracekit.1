.TH GNUNET-TRACEKIT "1" "25 Sept 2004" "GNUnet"
.SH NAME
gnunet\-tracekit \-\- overlay network traceing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-tracekit
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
gnunet\-tracekit can be used to visualize the GNUnet overlay network.  This tool broadcasts a message into the network querying every peer about a list of other connected peers. The result is then printed to the screen.
.PP
gnunet\-tracekit is primarily useful for developers to determine the structure of the network.  End\-users will find little use for the tool itself (except to satisfy their curiosity) but should at the moment still enable this protocol to help the developers that trace the network.
