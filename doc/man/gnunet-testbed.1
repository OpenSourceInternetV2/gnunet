gnunet-testbed can be used to control GNUnet peers to perform testing and benchmarking of the system.
Note that gnunet-testbed is at this point still a very new tool and not functional.
gnunet-testbed is fully scriptable and uses bash as a scripting language.  All features of bash
are supported, including the execution of arbitrary shell commands.  gnunet-testbed extends bash
with additional, testbed specific commands.
