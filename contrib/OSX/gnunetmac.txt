Welcome to GNUnet 0.6.6 (CVS) for MacOS X 10.3.x !

Installation:

For most users the default values supplied by the installer will be
sufficient. If you are behind a firewall then you may need to edit
the gnunet.root file. For instructions see http://www.gnunet.org

The installation will be created in ~/gnunet, where ~ refers to
your home directory. The two relevant files are: gnunet.root and
gnunet.conf. These files can be edited with textedit or with
the graphical configuration utility (Configure option).

The most important options in gnunet.root are:

Network interface: 	   What is your active network interface?
			   On most computers this will be either:
			   en0 = Ethernet or en1 = Wireless LAN.
			   In gnunet.root this setting correspond
			   to two options: [NETWORK] INTERFACE
			   and [LOAD] INTERFACE

IP number:		   Internet number of your computer.
   			   If you are using NAT and have mapped
			   the gnunet ports to your computer then
			   you should specify the IP address of
			   your router here. Otherwise it should
			   the IP address of your computer.
			   If your IP address changes from time
			   to time then you want to say NA here.
			   This avoids setting the IP number
			   to any fixed value. In gnunet.root
			   this setting corresponds to
			   [NETWORK] IP.

How long is your IP valid  If your IP number changes from time
    	    	    	   to time then you may want to give
			   gnunetd a hint how often this is
			   expected to happen. 1440 = 10 days.
			   In gnunet.root this corresponds to:
			   [GNUNETD] HELOEXPIRES.

Upstream bandwidth	   Bandwidth limit for upstream traffic.
	 		   Given in units of bytes/s. Set this
			   value based on your internet connection.
			   In gnunet.root this corresponds to:
			   [LOAD] [MAXNETUPBPSTOTAL].

Downstream bandwidth	   Bandwidth limit for downstream traffic.
	 		   Given in units of bytes/s. Set this
			   value based on your internet connection.
			   In gnunet.root this corresponds to:
			   [LOAD] [MAXNETDOWNBPSTOTAL].

Maximum CPU load	   This is the maximum CPU load that lets
	    		   gnunetd to run without dropping any
			   traffic. Small number means less load
			   to the system and larger number more
			   load. Note that if you don't want any
			   limits then set this to a large value
			   (for example, 800). In gnunet.root this
			   corresponds to: [LOAD] MAXCPULOAD.

UDP port number		   UDP port number to use. If your ISP
    	 		   is blocking certain ports then you may
			   want to change this. If you are using
			   NAT then you want to make this port
			   number to match your mapped port in
			   the router. In gnunet.root this 
			   corresponds to: [UDP] PORT.

TCP port number		   TCP port number to use. If your ISP
    	 		   is blocking certain ports then you may
			   want to change this. If you are using
			   NAT then you want to make this port
			   number to match your mapped port in
			   the router. In gnunet.root this
			   corresponds to: [TCP] PORT.

Limited connectivity	   Set this to YES if you are behind
			   a firewall and to NO if not.
			   In gnunet.root this corresponds to:
			   [NAT] LIMITED.

Anon. file sharing quota   How much disk space is allocated for
      	   	   	   storing GNUnet data. This space is
			   only used for full inserts and migrated
			   data. Thus it does not have to correspond
			   to the amount you of data you want to
			   share. The units are in megabytes.
			   Typically few megabytes is sufficient
			   unless you will be doing full inserts.
			   In gnunet.root this corresponds to:
			   [AFS] DISKQUOTA.

Anon. receive level	   Anonymity level for receving data.
      	      		   If the value v # is < 1000, it means that
      	      		   if GNUnet routes n bytes of messages from
			   # foreign peers, it may originate n/v bytes
			   of queries in the same # time-period. The
			   time-period is twice the average delay that
			   GNUnet # deferrs forwarded queries. If the
			   value v is >= 1000, it means that if GNUnet 
			   routes n bytes of QUERIES from at least (v
			   % 1000) peers, it may originate n/v/1000
			   bytes of queries in the same time-period.
			   The default is 0 and this should be fine 
			   for most users. Also notice that if you 
			   choose values above 1000, you may end up
			   having no throughput at all, especially if 
			   many of your fellow GNUnet-peers do the same.
			   This corresponds to gnunet.root setting:
			   [AFS] ANONYMITY-SEND option.

Anon. send level	   Anonymity level for sending data. See
      	   		   above. This corresponds to gnunet.root
			   setting: [AFS] ANONYMITY-RECEIVE option.

Active content migration   Should we participate in content
       	       		   migration? If you say yes here, GNUnet
			   will migrate content to your server, and
			   you will not be able to control what data
			   is stored on your  machine. This option
			   has advantages and disadvantages. If you
			   activate it, you can claim for *all*
			   the non-indexed (-n to gnunet-insert)
			    content that you did not know
			   what it was even if an adversary takes
			   control of your machine. If you do not
			   activate it, it is obvious that you have
			   knowledge of all the content that is hosted
			   on your machine and thus can be considered
			   liable for it. This corresponds to the
			   gnunet.root setting: 
			   [AFS] [ACTIVEMIGRATION].

Index quota		   Space allocated for storing the index.
      			   8192 is a good number. This corresponds
			   to the gnunet.root setting:
			   [AFS] [INDEX-QUOTA].

Log level		   Which gnunetd messages to log:
    			   nothing, fatal, error, failure, warning,
			   message, info, ...
			   Making gnunetd more verbose will cause
			   the log file to grow.
			   This corresponds to the gnunet.root
			   setting: [GNUNETD] LOGLEVEL.

Log rotation		   Rotate log files? If 0 no rotation is
    			   performed. If you specify a value 
			   greater than zero, a log is created each
			   day with the date appended to its filename.
			   These logs are deleted after given # of days.

The gnunet.conf file:

Search timeout		   Time out in seconds for gnunet-search
       			   command. This corresponds to
			   [AFS] SEARCHTIMEOUT setting in
			   gnunet.conf.

Usage:

GNUnet consists of server (gnunetd) and client programs. The
server will run in background and is usually started automatically
when necessary. If configuration files are changed then the server
process must be restarted. For most parts the graphical interface
will do this automatically.

The GNUnet graphical user interface uses X windows system (X11)
and assumes that a three button mouse is available. Usethe  alt
and apple keys to access second and third mouse buttons. 

The command line utilities can be found from directory: 
GNUnet.app/Contents/MacOS/bin. Alternatively you can launch a
shell from the GNUnet menu, which will automatically set the path
correctly. The commands are:

gnunet-search <keyword>
gnunet-download <URI>
gnunet-peer-info
gnunet-stats
gnunet-insert <file>

For more information, see the manual pages located in:
GNUnet.app/Contents/MacOS/man

Downloads will be placed in the gnunet-downloads directory in your
home directory.
