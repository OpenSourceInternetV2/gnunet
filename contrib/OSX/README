Few notes:

1. Running make will produce .app of GNUnet and dmg image containing the application.

2. To compile you will need bunch of stuff from fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net).

3. Since native GTK+2 does not exist, we have to rely on X11.

4. build_app is quite a hack! It first compiles as everything were to go
  under /usr/local. Then it uses install_name_tool etc. to relocate shared
  lib paths in executables and shared libs. It does all this by producing suitable
  directory stucture for .app. Patching all the binaries
  takes some time - be patient when running make. All the necessary shared libs
  will be picked up from fink ($SW variable in build_app).
  Can someone check Info.plist? I don't think it sets the icon correctly?

5. Better hostlist mechanism. For some reason, esp. behind a firewall,
the gnunetd hostlist mechanism does not get you anywhere. Hack:
I am including a static list with the App :-(

6. Added some dialogs etc. which rely on http://cocoadialog.sourceforge.net
   (assumed to be in ~/Applications directory)
