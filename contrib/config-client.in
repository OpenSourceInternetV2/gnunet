	help
                If EXPERIMENTAL is set to NO, options for experimental code are
       	        not shown.  If in doubt, use NO.

		Some options apply to experimental code that maybe in a state 
		of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
		testing is not yet high enough for general use.  These features 
		are said to be of "alpha" quality.   If a feature is currently in 
                alpha, uninformed use is discouraged (since the developers then
       	        do not fancy "Why doesn't this work?" type messages).

               	However, active testing and qualified feedback of these features
                is always welcome.  Users should just be aware that alpha features
		may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
		in some special cases.  Bug reports are usually welcomed by the 
                developers, but please read the documents <file://README> and 
       	        <http://gnunet.org/faq.php3> and use <https://gnunet.org/mantis/>
               	for how to report problems.

	help

		These are options that maybe difficult to understand for the
		beginner.  These options typically refer to features that
       	        allow tweaking of the installation.  If in a hurry, say NO.
  
	config RARE-CLIENT
	bool "Show rarely used options"  
	help
		These are options that hardly anyone actually needs.
		If you plan on doing development on GNUnet, you may want to
               	look into these.  If in doubt or in a hurry, say NO.

		Specify which additional extractor libraries should be used.
		gnunet-insert uses libextractor to extract keywords from files.
		libextractor can be dynamically extended to handle additional file
		formats. If you want to use more than the default set of extractors,
		specify additional extractor libraries here.  The format is
		[[-]LIBRARYNAME[:[-]LIBRARYNAME]*] The default is to use filenames
		and to break larger words at spaces (and underscores, etc.).  This
		should be just fine for most people. The - before a library name
		indicates that this should be executed last and makes only sense for
		the split-library.
		Default is libextractor_filename:-libextractor_split:-libextractor_lower:-libextractor_thumbnail

	default y
	depends on Meta::RARE-CLIENT
	help
		Disable symlinking.  When set to YES, GNUnet will always make
		a copy of the file when files are indexed.  The default is to
		try to use a symbolic link (if possible).
		Note that you should NEVER, NEVER simply delete the .gnunet 
		directory if this is set to 'NO', since all inserted files
		will have been moved into that directory and replaced with
		symbolic links.  So if you were to remove ~/.gnunet, you will
		loose those files unless you first run gnunet-delete to undo
		the symlinking!
		It is much more (space)-efficient to set this to NO,
		but you need to know what you're doing.  This is why the
		default is 'YES'.

	help
		How many (parallel) threads should a given gnunet-download (or
		gnunet-gtk) process run?  (this limits the amount of parallelism
		used in the FSUI library).  Smaller values reduce memory and CPU
		requirements.  Very large values will not be useful since even if
		that much parallelism is theoretically possible, the local node may
		not be able to route that many parallel requests anyway.  
		Default: 32
