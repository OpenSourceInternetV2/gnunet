This file describes special operations that must be performed for an
upgrade between GNUnet versions.  You can obtain version of GNUnet
that you have installed by running

$ gnunetd --version

If no migration procedure is listed for your version, a
data-preserving migration may not be possible.  For SVN versions,
you're on your own.

0.8.0pre0 to 0.8.0pre1
======================

Just run gnunet-update.


0.7.3 (and earlier) to 0.8.0pre0
================================

Migration of your datastore maybe possible but the required code has
not been written (we had bigger fish to fry).  In order to update, run
gnunet-update as usual.  Drop the tables in your old datastore(s) and
delete "$GNUNETD_HOME/data/fs/" and "$GNUNETD_HOME/data/shared/" and
"$GNUNETD_HOME/data/hosts/".

Note that due to the various breaks in backwards-compatibility, peers
running the new version will not connect to peers running 0.7.3 and
older.  Check that the hostlists that you are using in your
configuration file are for peers running HEAD.

Read up on gnunet-auto-share.
