This file lists the known problems with GNUnet on various platforms.

Let us know if you know more about it then we do.  The test is quite
easy.  Run "make check" and "gnunet-transport-check" *after*
configuring GNUnet (including placing a valid gnunet.conf into
~/.gnunet and /etc/gnunet.conf).  That should yield all the
information necessary (assuming it compiles).


Linux (x86):
- perfect

FreeBSD (x86):
- perfect

OpenBSD/NetBSD:
- unknown

Linux (Ultra Sparc):
- gcry RSA key generation does not work (hangs)
  workarounds: 
   use OpenSSL [confirmed]
   use libgcrypt [untested]

Linux (Alpha):
- gcry RSA key generation does not work (hangs or even crashes)
  workarounds:
   use OpenSSL [confirmed]
   use libgcrypt [untested]

Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8, Sparc SunFire 880):
- gcry test takes forever (bug?)
  workarounds: 
   use OpenSSL [confirmed]
   use libgcrypt [untested]
- IPC semaphore test fails (hmm, used to pass)

OS X (10.3, PowerPC):
- ar fails to build (bug in Apple-AR)
- gcry test takes forever (bug?)
  workarounds: 
   use OpenSSL [confirmed]
   use libgcrypt [untested]
- plugins are not found (FATAL)
- CRC errors at the end of downloads (?)

Cygwin (x86):
- plugins can not be loaded (FATAL)
- difficult to compile (autotools trouble)
- gcry doesn't link
- RSA_private_decrypt (OpenSSL) often fails
- gnunet-transport-check fails
- TCP transport doesn't work ("Transport endpoint is not connected")
- CTRL-C has no effect

MinGW (x86):
- gcry is not available
  workaround:
   use OpenSSL
- SMTP transport is not available
- gnunet-testbed is not available
