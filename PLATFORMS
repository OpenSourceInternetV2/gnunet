This file lists the known problems with GNUnet on various platforms.

Let us know if you know more about it then we do.  The test is quite
easy.  Run "make check" and "gnunet-transport-check" *after*
configuring GNUnet (including placing a valid gnunet.conf into
~/.gnunet and /etc/gnunet.conf).  That should yield all the
information necessary (assuming it compiles).


Linux (x86):
- perfect

FreeBSD (x86):
- perfect

OpenBSD/NetBSD:
- unknown

Linux (Ultra Sparc):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug) 
  workarounds: use OpenSSL

Linux (Alpha):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug)
  workaround: use OpenSSL 

Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8, Sparc SunFire 880):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug)
  workaround: use OpenSSL
- IPC semaphore test fails (hmm, used to pass, not critical)

OS X (10.3.7, PowerPC):
- RSA key generation may not work (libgcrypt bug)
  workaround: use OpenSSL

Cygwin (x86):
- plugins cannot be loaded (FATAL)
- difficult to compile (autotools trouble)
- RSA_private_decrypt (OpenSSL) often fails
- gnunet-transport-check fails
- TCP transport does not work ("Transport endpoint is not connected")
- CTRL-C has no effect

MinGW (x86):
- gettext may make problems, use --disable-nls
- libgcrypt may not be available
  workaround: use OpenSSL
- SMTP transport is not available
- gnunet-testbed is not available
