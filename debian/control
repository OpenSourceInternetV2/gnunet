Description: secure, trust-based peer-to-peer framework (meta)
 GNUnet is a peer-to-peer framework which focuses on providing security. All
 link-to-link messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. The
 framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate
 the peer-to-peer traffic in UDP, TCP, or SMTP messages.
