gnunet for Debian
-----------------

GNUnet starts by default at boot time. To change the default behaviour, run:

	# dpkg-reconfigure -plow gnunet-daemon

In order to start, stop or restart manually the daemon, use:

	# /etc/init.d/gnunet-daemon

with the parameter start, stop or restart.

Note: You cannot upgrade GNUnet directly from versions earlier than 0.6.1b,
refer to the file UPDATING for information on how to migrate your data.

GNUnet has a global config file, /etc/gnunet.conf, for some programs (e.g.
gnunet-stats) it may also need a per user config file, a sample of which is the
included gnunet.user which can be copied to ~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf
