gnunet for Debian
-----------------

GNUnet start at boot time by default, to change the default behaviour, you must run
dpkg-reconfigure gnunet

In order to start, stop or restart manually the daemon, use
/etc/init.d/gnunet with the parameter start, stop or restart

You cannot upgrade GNUnet directly from versions earlier than 0.6.1b,
refer to the file UPGRADING for information on how to migrate your data.

GNUnet has a global config file, /etc/gnunet.conf, for some programs
(e.g. gnunet-stats) it may also need a per user config file, a sample of
which is the included gnunet.user which can be copied to
~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf
