gnunet (0.6.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied Martin Quinson l10n patch wich switch to gettext-based debconf and
    does the following modifications (Closes: #283632):
    - debian/control: modification for dependencies:
      build-dep: debhelper (>= 4.1.16) which depends on po-debconf.
      depend: debconf (>= 1.2.0) since old versions have problems with
      templates specifying the encoding of their content.
    - debian/rules: Add 'debconf-updatepo' to the clean target   
      (to make sure that the relevant files are ready for translation in the
      distributed source packages, and thus help translators).
    - execute "debconf-gettextize debian/*templates*". 
    - update the style to the best current practice.

  * Applied Andreas Jochens patch to fix build process on AMD64 with gcc 4.0
    (Closes #289496).
