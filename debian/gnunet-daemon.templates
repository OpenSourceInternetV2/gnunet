# Obsolete, should be removed
Template: gnunet-daemon/prior_07
Type: note
_Description: Upgrade from a version prior to 0.7.0
 It seems that you are upgrading GNUnet from a version prior to 0.7.x.
 GNUnet 0.7.x introduced new configuration files and a new database
 storage format which is not compatible with versions prior to 0.7.x.
 .
 GNUnet cannot convert your database format to the new format.
 .
 Your database storage will be automatically moved to /var/lib/GNUnet.prior07,
 and the gnunet package will build a new empty storage for you.
 .
 Your /etc/gnunet.conf file will also be moved to /etc/gnunet.conf.prior07
 and replaced by /etc/gnunetd.conf which you can modify later by running
 "gnunet-setup -d -c /etc/gnunetd.conf", as root.
